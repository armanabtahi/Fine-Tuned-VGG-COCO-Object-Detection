# Fine-Tuned-VGG-COCO-Object-Detection
This repository also contains a two layer neural network added on top of the fine-tuned VGG-16 model for further fine-tuning. The two layer neural network is trained to classify the images of the COCO dataset into 80 different classes. The output of the VGG-16 model is fed as input to this two layer neural network and it is trained to improve the performance of the model on the COCO dataset. The architecture of this additional network is also provided in the repository.
